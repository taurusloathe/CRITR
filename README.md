To get the best results from the contract at the current default parameters, deployer needs only 2 wallets. 1 wallet to purchase 9 tokens with ETH, and the second wallet purchases 1 token with ETH. After the second wallet purchase, your first wallet can now swap the 9 tokens for more of another ERC-20 based token.
