# Updates:
# Cross-Chain Bridge
The constructor now initializes the Wormhole bridge contract and the Solana chain ID, allowing users to exchange CRITR for Solana.
# UniswapX Protocol Integration
UniswapX aggregates both onchain and offchain liquidity, internalizes MEV in the form of price improvement, offers gas-free swaps, and can be extended to support cross-chain trading. You can access the full whitepaper here: https://uniswap.org/whitepaper-uniswapx.pdf

Users of the social network will be able to earn these tokens, which will be redeemable for any ERC-20 based token on Uniswap. A vesting schedule will be implemented, allowing users of the social network to receive a additional tokens every month for participating on the platform.
