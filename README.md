# Updates:
# Cross-Chain Bridge
The constructor of the token contract deployed deployed from the factory contract now initializes the Wormhole bridge contract and the Solana chain ID, allowing users to exchange CRITR for Solana.
# UniswapX Protocol Integration
UniswapX aggregates both onchain and offchain liquidity, internalizes MEV in the form of price improvement, offers gas-free swaps, and can be extended to support cross-chain trading. You can access the full whitepaper here: https://uniswap.org/whitepaper-uniswapx.pdf
